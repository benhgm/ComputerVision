# Simple code for combining images with similar features to get a fused image
This is a mini-project for performing image fusion for images with similar features.

In this case, I had four cycling routes that I wanted to display together to show how much road I covered in the same image, but Google Maps places a limit on the number of stops you can add to your route. Then when you create individual routes, Google Maps places a limit on the number of routes you can put together to form a new 'My Map'.

Hence, this project was borne.
